# saiku-backup

This is an **experimental** utility for backing up and restoring [Saiku Analytics] repository and users. It's primary
purpose is restoring state between [kynx/saiku-client] integration tests. It might come in handy for developers 
dumping and reloading stuff, but it is **not** an appropriate tool for backing up a production install.
